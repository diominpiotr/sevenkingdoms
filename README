Seven Kingdoms: Ancient Adversaries
-----------------------------------

Release version 2.13.2
Project website: www.7kfans.com

This is the release of the Seven Kingdoms: Ancient Adversaries source
code as authorized by Enlight by the 7kfans project.  The game is
provided under the terms of the GPL.  See the file "COPYING" for the
details of the license.

This release brings Linux support for the game through the Wine API.
The game source should remain compatable with Windows as well.  
However, this release is intended as an interim solution for linux
and Windows users while the game undergoes an extensive rewrite to
make it truly multiplatform.

This version of the game deprecates the I*Magic network library and
DirectPlay.  Building the game will disable the network option by
default.  Renable it at your own risk.  In the future, the 7kfans
project intends to replace the network code anyhow.


Building the game
---------

General Requirements
* GCC 3.0 or later
* JWasm 2.00 or later
* Perl (checked with 5.10.1)

Linux
* Wine 1.1.34 or later

Windows
* DX7 SDK (later not tested)


We do not (yet?) provide the typical Makefile setup.  To build
execute:
./configure.pl
Followed by:
./build.pl

This will build the game suited for your system.  If this does
not work, please tell us.


Running
--------
You can download the game data if you do not already have the game
installed. You can find the game data from the 7kfans sourceforge
page at http://sourceforge.net/projects/skfans/

Copy the executable files "7kaa.exe*" from the build directory to
your installed game directory.  Run 7kaa.exe to start the game
instead of the classic enlight version called 7k.exe.  You may
create a short-cut now.


Other Tips
---------

Since the game runs on Wine's DDraw, users may find the game runs
rather slow for such an old game.  We cannot correct this issue when
using DDraw, but there are solutions found over at the Wine Project:
